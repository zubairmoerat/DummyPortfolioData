Joel worked under my guidance for one year during my time as Head of Curriculum and Learning at Lifechoices Academy. His expertise in C++, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, JavaScript, and Node.js is truly impressive, and he effortlessly demonstrates proficiency in these technologies. However, what truly sets Joel apart is his exceptional teaching skills. He has a natural talent for breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible bits, making the learning process enjoyable and engaging. Joel's patience and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure every student grasps the material are truly commendable. I consider myself fortunate to have learned from him, and I wholeheartedly recommend him as an outstanding educator.",
